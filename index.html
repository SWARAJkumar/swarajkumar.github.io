        	<h1>Hi there, I'm Swaraj Kumar!</h1>
		<p>I'm senior undergraduate studying computer engineering at University of Delhi<br> 
		 I am a developer and naive researcher who likes working on challenging but crazy projects. Most of my 
		 work is interdisciplinary. I like to use my comuter science and engineering background to solve problems in other domains 
	         such as linguistics, phonetics,neuroscience, game theory, signals etc..	
	         
		 I am currently looking for collaborating with awesome people to take on challenging endevours.
