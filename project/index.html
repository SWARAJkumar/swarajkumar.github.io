<H2>Brown University</H2>
Postion: Research Intern </br>
Interned in Laboratory of Neural Computation and Cognition, under supervision of Professor Dr. Michael J. Frank.</br>
Wroked on implementing reinforcement learning in spiking neural networks and studying noise and signal correlations in teh network.
Aim of the internship was to combine two literatures: RL in spiking networks and Neural Correaltions. The research work still in progress.</br> 
Tools used: Python, Matlab, Google Colaboratory, Brian </br>
Concepts: Spiking Neural Networks, Neural Correlations, Reinforcement Learning</br></br>

Postion: Summer Trainee</br>
Developed a classifier system using convolution neural networks for detecting and identifying underwater objects using hydrophone data recordings by a
submarine. Also, was instrumental in the development of triplet hydrophone sensor, which can calculate the direction of arrival while recording 
the underwater signals. Supervised by Scientist Sanjeev Kumar.</br>
Tools used: Python, Keras, Matlab </br>
Concepts: Convolution Neural Networks, Signal Processing, COmmunication Systems, Digital Circuits and Systems</br></br>

<H2> eXtended Learning Systems (XCS)</H2>
Postion: Research Assistant</br>
Created a rule based Artificial Intelligent (AI) agent to learn the optimal game playing strategy for Othello (a combinatorial board game,
very popular in AI research) by evolving the rule population through a combination of Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Algorithm.
The agent showed a high winning percentage when tested against other state of the art Othello play-ing AI agents.
Supervised by Dr. Swati Aggarwal, Professor of Artificial Intelligence in NSIT
The project resulted in a paper which has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE CEC 2018(Brazil) and for publication in the 
conference proceedings published by IEEE
</br>
Tools used: Java, Python, Latex</br>
Concepts: Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithm, XCS</br></br>

<H2>Computational Linguistics</H2>
Topic:Understanding Language Dependency on Emotional Speech using Siamese Network</br>
Aim to study the susceptibility of emotions, expressed in speech, to different languages. The Project introduces a novel Deep Convolution 
Siamese Network (DCSN) for determining the similarity between speech samples.The results provided a conclusive proof for the model to be used 
for the study of different psychological aspects of emotional speech. Paper is under submission in EMNLP-2018 to be held in Belgium.</br>
Tools:Python, Keras</br>
Concepts: Deep Learning, Siamese Networks</br></br>

<H2>Emotion Morphing in Speech</H2>
Introduced a deep learning approach to transform emotions in natural speech without altering acoustic features. Developed a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
based Encoder and multiple shallow CNN Decoders for morphing emotions. Paper is under submission in Interspeech, 2018.
