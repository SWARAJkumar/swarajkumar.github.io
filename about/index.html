   I live in Vasant Kunj, Delhi. I am 100% delhite by heart though I was born in Patna, Bihar. Apart from computer science, I love travelling 
   as I get to explore cultures and evironments that are different from my comfort zone. I am passionate about identifying problems and 
   trying to work on finding their solutions.</br>

   <h3>My Idols</h3>
   <b>Geoffrey Hinton </b>: Have cited him extensively in my research work for obvious reasons. He is the pioneer of deep learning and most 
   importantly he was working on once perceived uncool research on neural networks before it became cool.</br></br>
   
   <b>Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal</b>: Father of modern neuroscience and Nobel Prize winner. His drawings of neurons are still one of the best
   in the field.</br></br>
   
   <b>Subhas Chandra Bose</b>: No better example for exemplary courage combined with sharp thinking. I am inspired by his vision for India and the way he decided
   to fight the colonial powers despite no main stream independence leader supporting him.</br></br>
   
   <b>Nawazuddin Siddiqui</b>: I rarely watch movies, but I watch all nawaz bhai's movies. Outstanding actor. Challenges himself and never gave
   up on his dream of becoming a successful actor. Broke the mindeset of how a conventional bollywood actor is perceived in India.
